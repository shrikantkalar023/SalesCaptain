This is copy of [**SalesCaptain**](https://salescaptain.com/) website. I was given an assignment to recreate homepage & login page of the above mentioned website for a job application.

While I was a little late, I managed to submit mobile-only view of the website within the time frame given, but they stopeed responding so I guess I was rejected there. It's all good though, I had great practice of [**Tailwind CSS**](https://tailwindcss.com/) through this project.

I am yet to add login page & also I will make the website responsive till 4k screen size.

## Ways to improve this project:-

1. Replace all the img tags with next.js [Image component](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/components/link).

2. I kind of have poor implementation of hamburger menu component, the clickable part. I will explore this & update.

3. Most components can be refactored for scalability.

4. Design can be better.

I used [**Next.js**](https://nextjs.org/) & [**Tailwind CSS**](https://tailwindcss.com/) for this project.

This project is deployed on [**Vercel**](https://vercel.com/).
